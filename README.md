This file has been created for demonstration purpose. 
The script works in R, and the main job is to find the most similar genes to the query genes or as bioinformatics community calls it "Gene prioritization".
The script reads some input files which are networks data (omics\interaction) such as PPI, gene coexpression network, GRN, etc. and by modeling the relationship between query genes and other genes it prioritizes genes based on the similarity measures which have been calculated already. For more detailed information you can read my paper "Ehsan Sabaghian, Z Drebert, Dirk Inz√©, Yvan Saeys.
